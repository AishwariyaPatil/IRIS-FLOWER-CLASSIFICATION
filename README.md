# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project is focused on classifying Iris flowers into different species using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this classification task is obtained from Kaggle. The classification model is built using Spyder IDE and scikit-learn library.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- Spyder IDE (installed via Anaconda or standalone installation)
- scikit-learn (installed via pip or conda)
- pandas (installed via pip or conda)
- numpy (installed via pip or conda)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Iris dataset. It consists of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and the corresponding species label for each data point.

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Launch Spyder IDE and open the iris_classification.py file.
3. Run the script to load the Iris dataset, visualize the data, and build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier and Logistic Regression model on it.
4. Evaluate the performance of the models and predict the accuracy of the classification.
